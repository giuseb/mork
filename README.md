# Mork

A ruby [optical mark recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mark_recognition) (OMR) library aimed at accomplishing two tasks in the context of paper-based, multiple-choice tests and surveys:

1. generating [response sheets](/spec/samples/sheet.jpg) in PDF format
2. capturing the responses provided on the [printed sheet](/spec/samples/sample_gray.jpg) by a human with a pen or a pencil.

## Assumptions and limitations

Mork is a low-level library, and very much work in progress. It is not, and will likely never be a complete OMR solution. While suggestions and contributions are more than welcome, for the time being several assumptions and restrictions to what the library is capable of apply.

- the PDF files generated by Mork are intended to be printed on regular printer paper
- the entire response sheet must fit into a single page
- after collecting the responses, a filled-out form should be acquired as a JPEG, PNG, or PDF image by a normal optical scanner or camera (i.e., no specialized equipment is necessary)
- the response sheet contains the following items:
  - registration marks at each page corner
  - a bar code along the bottom margin to uniquely identify the sheet
  - a header area to print arbitrary information
  - a response area containing a list of numbered items (questions)
  - each item contains an arbitrary number of choice “cells”, each marked with a capital letter (A, B, C, ...)
  - the far right side of the response area is reserved for a column of calibration cells that must remain blank
- it is entirely up to the user to provide parameters that produce the desired response sheet layout; in particular, making sure that the header elements and choice cells fit in the available space, as Mork does not provide any type of "sanity" check at this time.

## Getting started

First, make sure that ImageMagick is installed in your system. On the Mac, `brew` is the preferred package manager:

    brew install imagemagick

To create a small ruby project that uses Mork, `cd` into a directory of choice, then execute the following shell commands:

```
mkdir mork_test
cd mork_test
echo "source 'http://rubygems.org'" > Gemfile
echo "gem 'mork'" >> Gemfile
echo "require 'mork'" > mork_test.rb
echo "include Mork" >> mork_test.rb
bundle install
```

Edit the file `mork_test.rb` with the code snippets below, then execute the following shell command to see the result:

    bundle exec ruby mork_test.rb

## Generating response sheets with `SheetPDF`

Response sheets are created through the `Mork::SheetPDF` class. Two pieces of information must be provided to the class constructor to produce a meaningful object:

- **content**: what to place on the sheet, such as how many response items and choices, what to write in the header, the number to print as a barcode
- **layout**: sizes, margins, spacing, fonts, etc., of each of the printed elements

Let’s look at each argument in turn.

### content

The `content` argument should be a hash like the following:

```ruby
content = {
  # the response sheet's unique identifier; it is printed
  # in binary form as a barcode at the bottom of the sheet
  barcode: 123456,
  # number of items and number of choices per item
  # in this case: 100 items with 5 choices each
  choices: [5] * 100,
  # stuff to print in the header
  header: {
    name: 'John Doe UI354320',
    title: 'Anatomy and Physiology test, Sept 20, 2014',
    code:  '201.48',
    signature: 'Signature'
  }
}
```

These are the key-value pairs that the `content` hash should contain:

- **barcode**: an integer number, the sheet's unique identifier
- **choices**: an array of integers, specifiying the number of items in the test (the length of the array) and the number of choices available for each item (the array values)
- **header**: a (sub)hash of key-value pairs defining the content of named header elements; in each pair, the key is the name of one header element, while the value is the rendered content; the actually available elements are defined in the `layout` (see below)

### layout

The layout argument is also defined as a hash, but because of its length and since the layout often stays identical across many response sheets, it is usually more convenient to write the information in a YAML file and pass its path/filename to the `SheetPDF` constructor instead. Here is the YAML version of a standard layout hash. Please note that the parameters with an (*) in the comment have no effect on PDF production, but are relevant to OMR scan (see further below).

```yaml
page_size:                # all measurements in mm
  width:          210     # width of the paper sheet
  height:         297     # height of the paper sheet
reg_marks:         
  margin:          10     # distance from each page border to registration mark center
  radius:           2.5   # registration mark radius
  crop:            12     # size of the registration mark search area (*)
  offset:           2     # distance between the search area and each page border (*)
  blur:             2     # size of a gaussian blur filter to smooth overly pixelated registration marks (0 to skip)
  dilate:           5     # size of a “dilate” filter to get rid of stray noise (0 to skip)
header:           
  name:                   # ‘name’ is just a label; you can add arbitrary header elements
    top:            5     # margin relative to registration frame top side
    left:           7.5   # margin relative to registration frame left side
    width:         170    # text will be fitted to this width
    size:           14    # font size
  title:
    top:            15
    left:           7.5
    width:         180
    size:           12

    width:          20
    size:           14
  signature:
    top:            30
    left:            7.5
    width:         120
    height:         15
    size:            7
    box:          true    # header element will be enclosed in a box
items:
  top:              55.5  # response area margin, relative to reg frame
  left:             10.5  # response area margin, relative to reg frame
  rows:             30    # number of items per column
  columns:           4    # number of columns
  column_width:     44    # 
  x_spacing:         7    # horizontal distance between ajacent cell centers
  y_spacing:         7    # vertical distance between ajacent cell centers
  cell_width:        6    # width of each choice and calibration cell
  cell_height:       5    # height of each choice and calibration cell
  max_cells:         5    # maximum number of choices per item
  font_size:         9    # size of both the item number and choice cell letter
  number_width:      8    # 
  number_margin:     2    # margin between
barcode:
  bits:             40    # the maximum sheet identifier is 2 to the power or bits
  left:             15    # distance between registration frame side and the first barcode bit
  width:             3    # width of each barcode bit
  height:            2.5  # height of each barcode bit from the registration frame bottom side
  spacing:           4    # horizontal distance between adjacent barcode bit centers
```

Assuming that the above text is written in a file named `layout.yml`, here's how to create a `SheetPDF` object and write the PDF file to disk:

```ruby
s = SheetPDF.new content, 'layout.yml'
s.save 'sheet.pdf'
system 'open sheet.pdf' # this works in OSX
```

It's easy to see that by iterating over a series of `content` hashes you can produce any number of sheets, all based on the same layout but each containing unique information (notably the barcode, but also names, dates, etc.)

If the `layout` argument is omitted, Mork will search for a file named `layout.yml` and load it. If such file cannot be found, Mork will fall back to a default, boilerplate layout (incidentally, this is the layout shown above).

## Scoring response sheets with `SheetOMR`

Assuming that a person has filled out a response sheet by darkening with a pen the selected choices, and that the sheet has been acquired as an image file, response scoring is performed by the `Mork::SheetOMR` class. Three pieces of information must be provided to the object constructor:

- **image**: the path/filename of the bitmap image (currently accepts JPG, JPEG, PNG, PDF extensions; a resolution of 150-200 dpi is usually more than sufficient to obtain accurate readings)
- **choices**: equivalent to the `choices` array of integers passed to the `SheetPDF` constructor as part of the `content` parameter (see above)
- **layout**: same as for the `SheetPDF` class

The following code shows how to create and analyze a SheetOMR based on a bitmap file named `image.jpg`:

```ruby
# instantiating the object
s = SheetOMR.new 'image.jpg', [5]*100, 'layout.yml'
# detecting darkened choice cells for the 100 items
chosen = s.mark_array
```

If all goes well, the `chosen` array will contain 100 sub-arrays, each containing the list of darkened choices for that item, where the first cell is indicated by a 0, the second by a 1, etc. It is also possible to show the scoring graphically:

```ruby
s = SheetOMR.new 'image.jpg', 'layout.yml'
s.highlight
s.write 'highlights.jpg'
system 'open highlights.jpg' # OSX only
```
